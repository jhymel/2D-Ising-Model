# 2D-Ising-Model

2D Ising model project, developed as part of statistical mechanics course (Chem 6481) during Spring 2020.

 - Builds an NxN lattice of spins
 - Equilibrates system using a numerical Monte Carlo method (Metropolis)
 - Computes average magnetization, average energy, and average energy^2
 - Visualizes trajectories using Matplotlib.pyplot
 
Based on 1944 Physical Review paper by Lars Onsager, which was "one of the major achievements of
20th century science" according to David Chandler. A PDF of this paper is included in this repo.
